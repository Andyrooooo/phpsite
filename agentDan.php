        <h4>Biography:</h4>
        <p>In 2015 I went to Jamaica for a friend's wedding and instantly fell in love with travel. I returned from that trip with a desire to continue my exploration and applied for 
            a job with Liberty Travel. I worked for Cabot Cruises from 2015 through 2017 and spent a lot of time going to all-inclusive destinations such as Mexico, Dominican Republic, 
            Jamaica, and more. Later I gained experience working in Flight Centre's corporate headquarters selling tours and then GOGO Vacations. During this time, I had the chance to 
            go to Italy and it was one of my most memorable vacations! In 2021 I created Ahearn Travel Group, LLC and partnered up with Cabot Cruises. Throughout my travel career I have 
            been to over 17 different countries. I have a passion for visiting unique destinations and exploring all the world has to offer. And I can't wait to help share my knowledge 
            with others to better their vacation experiences.</p>
